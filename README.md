## Objective
The objective of this project is to practice the `pandas` data wrangling and cleaning library and the `matplotlib` and `seaborn` visualization libraries. In order to do so, a dataset involving fatal police shootings in the US compiled by *The Washington Post* is analyzed.

## Project Structure
The structure and contents of the project are as follows:
- `input/`: the dataset compiled by *The Washington Post* in `.csv` format.
- `notebooks/`: three jupyter notebooks.
  1. `cleaning.ipynb`: cleaning process (although the dataset is almost perfect).
  2. `storytelling.ipynb`: storytelling with a bunch of visualizations.
  3. `shootingsapi.ipynb`: notebook prepared for playing with the different plotting functions created.
- `output/`: the clean dataset in `.csv` format.
- `src/`: two source code files.
  1. `cleanfuncs.py`: functions used in the cleaning process.
  2. `shootingsapi.py`: plotting functions for this particular dataset.
